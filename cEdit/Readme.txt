Thanks to Vinchenzo For his Code to catch the compiler output!

of this is at:

http://www.pscode.com/vb/scripts/showcode.asp?txtCodeId=24674&lngWId=1

It is done excelently and he deserves some credit for it.

Thanks:

Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who helped me. Way to many to
list them all. So thanks :)

Whats the purpose?

Well cEdit is a code editor obviously. It's purpose is relativly
strait forward. It's meant to be used to edit code. 

Why I wrote this?

I frequently code muds. They are most often written in c/c++, and
run on linux. Obviously linux has it's own built in compilers for
these languages but it doesn't have any kind editor to go along
with these. I usually just edit my files in notepad but I always
wanted syntax highlighting. Then one day I stumbled upon CodeMax
which is a code editing control by winmain. http://www.winmain.com.
This made it possible for me with a minimum of time to write a 
very complete and very nice code editing application. And so here
is cEdit. 

How much is it?

Some may wonder why I was so happy to find this codemax control and
then to make my own editor. I mean there are a number of editors
out there. Example: UltraEdit. UltraEdit is a very nice editor. But
it's not free. This editor is free. Anyone may use it, and or modify
the code.

How do I modify code?

Well you can modify code using visual basic. Then compile it into the
EXE. If you do I ask a few favors. Your welcome to add your name to
the about box but don't remove mine. Leave me as the main creator.
Also if you make any great improvements send me a copy at 
ackbar81@hotmail.com. I'd really like to see it. No code is perfect
but some is better than others :)

Can I sell a modified copy?

Well I guess if you can manage to convince someone to pay money for it
sure. But remember this is GNU so if they then want to give the full 
copy to their friends for free it's legal. You can't sue them for it :)

Why did you switch to registry?

Mostly for speed. INI files work great but they just aren't as fast as
the registry. So I switched over to it. Hope nobody minds. But it improves
the overall speed greatly and works nicely, also I think it might reduce
the overall ram usage which is always a plus :)

Quick Nav Side Bar:

With this you get quick file access and html tag list.

Built In FTP?

Basicly you can download and upload files onto an ftp server right from
in this program. I added this feature cause I code muds and make 
websites frequently so it helps greatly :)

Well that being said. Thanks for downloading cEdit. I hope you enjoy it
and find many uses for it.
